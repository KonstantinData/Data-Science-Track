    "### **Understanding Probability with Axioms**\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability helps us measure **how likely** something is to happen. To make it formal, we follow three basic rules called **axioms of probability**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability is always non-negative:**  \n",
    "   Every event \\( A \\) has a probability that is **never** less than zero:  \n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(A) ≥ 0\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   This means we **can’t have negative probability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The probability of the entire sample space is 1:**  \n",
    "   The **sample space** \\( S \\) includes all possible outcomes. The total probability of all possible events must be 1:  \n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(S) = 1\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   For example, if you roll a die, you **must** get a number between 1 and 6. The probability of getting *any* number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) **adds up to 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **For mutually exclusive events, probabilities add up:**  \n",
    "   If two events \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) **cannot happen at the same time** (for example, rolling a 1 **or** rolling a 2 on a die), their combined probability is:  \n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(A_1 ∪ A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   More generally, for **multiple** mutually exclusive events \\( A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots \\), the probability of at least one of them happening is:  \n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ A_3 ∪ ...) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) + ...\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "- Suppose you **flip a coin**.  \n",
    "  - The probability of **getting heads** is \\( P(H) = 0.5 \\).\n",
    "  - The probability of **getting tails** is \\( P(T) = 0.5 \\).\n",
